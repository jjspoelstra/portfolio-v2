            <p> I'm a software engineer with a past in crisis counseling and IT consulting. I've seen how poor software can cause stress for <b>everyone</b> involved. Having decided to take matters into my own hands, I now work as a freelancer. I strive to create web applications that are both easy to use and provide a genuine service to people, whether for joy, utility, or anything in-between. When I'm not coding, you'll find me writing short stories or working on my upcoming novel.</p>
